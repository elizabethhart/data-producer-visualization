# Requirements

- Design an intuitive, organized, and visually-appealing UI to display the real-time data from all 10 producers.
- Plot the data from each producer, correlated by timestamp.
- Update the charts in real-time as new data arrives from the producers.
- Optionally, provide extra features to users to only look at data within a specified timeframe and view data insights for each set of data within that timeframe (e.g., min, max, average).
- Organize the described features into an intuitive and simple layout that does not overwhelm the users.
